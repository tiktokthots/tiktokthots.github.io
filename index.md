## What's TikTokThots Subreddit?

TikTok is a video platform. There it is called DouYin.

At TikTokThots, users can record and upload short, self-made videos, which can be accompanied by music from current songs or film scenes. Most of the fairly young users use TikTok to create creative and funny videos. Often there is dancing and lip-synching in the videos, but there are also funny everyday scenes, comedy, sports or pranks, i.e. pranks. The video snippets are usually 15 seconds long, but they can also be longer.

TikTok offers many editing options for the videos; different filters are particularly popular, especially face filters. Time-lapse and other effects are also popular.

Because TikTok users can share their videos with others on Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp, it is also a social network. TikTok is thus similar to the social media platform Instagram. The young people can get in touch via comments or integrated chats.

There are now also YouTube channels that present the best current TikTok videos.
